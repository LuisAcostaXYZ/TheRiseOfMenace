<h1>The rise of MENACE</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The Rise of MENACE is a TicTacToe game that implements machine learning to strengthen a CP opponent "menace". <br />
Meance starts its journey to TicTacToe mastery not knowing any strategy and just playing random moves. However, <br />
with each victory and defeat it starts developing a sense of good and bad moves. The only limit to its skill is perfection. <br />
Based on Donald Michie's experiment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine).

<br />
(1) "Human to play MENACE": In this option, the user challenges MENACE at its current skill level to a TicTacToe game.<br />
(2) "Train MENACE against perfect player": In this option MENACE goes into an intensive bootcamp session against the <br />
  strongest TicTacToe player. This player knows every possible possition on the board, it can not lose. (The session is <br />
  worth 500 games)<br />
(3) "Train menace against random player": MENACE learns from its mistakes, but not every CP does the same. By selectiing <br />
  this option, menace engages in a 500-games session against a CP that only plays random moves. <br />
(4) "Train MENACE against another MENACE": Every althet can benefit from having a rival, MENACE is no exception. This <br />
  option gives MENACE a rival that learns at the same pase as itself. Then, they go into a 500-games training session. <br />
(5) "Delete (both) MENACE training sets": If MENACE becomes too much to handle, you can reset its experience to zero <br />
  (This also resets its rival's level) <br />
